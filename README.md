Augmented Reality Windshield Heads Up Display  
By: Paul Barsa, Conor Bilz, Anthony Guadnagno, and Mario Guardado  
This is our project for the 2019-2020 Engineering Design and Development Class at Monroe Township High School.
It is the protype for a device that displays 3D navigation information and car diagnostics directly on a windshield using a projector.
